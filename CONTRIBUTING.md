## Development Setup

1. **Prerequisites**
   - [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
   - [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) (for testing)
   - An Azure subscription with appropriate permissions

2. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/obay/azmg.git
   cd azmg
   ```

3. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

4. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   dotnet test
   ```

5. **Run the application locally**
   ```bash
   dotnet run -- --help
   ```

## Coding Style

* Use the default .NET coding conventions
* Use meaningful variable and method names
* Keep methods small and focused
* Write XML documentation for public APIs
* Use async/await for all Azure API calls
* Handle exceptions appropriately
* Use nullable reference types effectively

### Example Code Style

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Retrieves all management groups from Azure.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="armClient">The authenticated ARM client.</param>
/// <returns>A dictionary of management groups keyed by name.</returns>
public async Task<Dictionary<string, ManagementGroupResource>> GetManagementGroupsAsync(
    ArmClient armClient)
{
    ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(armClient);
    
    var managementGroups = new Dictionary<string, ManagementGroupResource>();
    
    await foreach (var mg in armClient.GetManagementGroups().GetAllAsync())
    {
        _logger.LogDebug("Processing management group: {Name}", mg.Data.Name);
        managementGroups[mg.Data.Name] = mg;
    }
    
    return managementGroups;
}
```

## Testing

* Write unit tests for new functionality
* Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
* Include integration tests for Azure interactions (using mocked responses)
* Test with different authentication methods
* Test error scenarios

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run with coverage
dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true /p:CoverletOutputFormat=opencover

# Run specific test
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~TestClassName.TestMethodName"
```

## Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Examples

```
Add CSV output format support

- Implement CSV formatter for management groups and subscriptions
- Add --output csv command line option
- Update documentation with CSV examples

Fixes #123
```
